HTML Description
This HTML file sets up the structure of a webpage that creates a visually appealing background animation. Here's what each part does:

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document as an HTML5 file.
<html lang="en">: Defines the language as English.
<head> Section:
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Ensures proper character encoding (UTF-8) for the document.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Makes the webpage responsive for different screen sizes.
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage as "Background Animation."
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">: Links the external CSS file to define the page's styles.
<body> Section:
Contains a div element with a class name container where the animation will take place.
<script src="script.js">: Links the external JavaScript file to add interactive functionality.

CSS Description
The CSS file creates the visual elements and animations for the background:

Global Styles (*):

Resets the default margin and padding.
Sets the background color to azure.
Changes the cursor style to "grabbing."
.container:

Centers its child elements (span) using flexbox.
Ensures it takes the full height (100vh) and width (100%) of the viewport.
Enables wrapping for child elements using flex-wrap: wrap.
Prevents overflow with overflow: hidden.
.container span:

Defines each span as a flex container with a minimum size of 20px by 20px.
Positions the span elements relative to their parent container.
.container span::before:

Adds a pseudo-element (::before) for each span to hold the background image.
Sets the image as a fixed background with background-attachment: fixed.
Hides the image initially with opacity: 0 and ensures it doesnâ€™t interfere with events using pointer-events: none.
Enables smooth scaling with transition: 20s.
.container span:hover::before:

When a span is hovered, the ::before pseudo-element grows to 1000% of its original size instantly (transition: 0s) and becomes visible (opacity: 1).
JavaScript Description
The JavaScript file dynamically creates the elements that make up the animation:

Loop (for Loop):
Runs 1999 times (from 1 to 1999) to create individual span elements.
Element Creation:
Each iteration creates a span element using document.createElement("span").
The span is appended to the .container div using appendChild.
Result:
Populates the .container div with 1999 small span elements, each capable of responding to hover events.
Behavior Summary
The JavaScript dynamically fills the .container with 1999 span elements.
Each span contains a pseudo-element (::before) that holds a background image.
On hovering over a span, its background image expands dramatically, creating a ripple or zoom effect centered on the hovered element.
